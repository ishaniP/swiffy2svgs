# Swiffy2SVG #

Extracts SVG frames from a swiffy animation.
Runs on a php server.

Usage:

* Upload a swiffy html file.
* Select a frame rate (the higher the more svgs you will get).
* Start! .. and Stop! as soon as the animation is over.
* Download your svgs.
* Please refresh the page for another go. Cheers!

It also probably breaks with concurrent uses and in multiple other ways, so please follow the path..
